MORCE - Malice Observing, Reporting and Collecting Engine
=========================================================

MORCE is a collection of simple scripts that integrates Snort[1] into
OpenWrt[2] and provides easy means how to be notified about any potential
security issue (as recognized by Snort) and how to store and manage a history
of such events.

Installation
------------

MORCE depends on snort3 including snort2lua tool to convert rules.
Installation is pretty straight forward. Apart from Snort itself you need to
deploy the following files into following directories:

`init/morce` -> `/etc/init.d/morce`
`logger/alert_morce.lua` -> `/usr/share/morce/loggers/alert_morce.lua`

Cron
~~~~

It is highly recommended to setup a cron script that would periodically check
for updated rules. That can be done via calling `/etc/init.d/morce update_rules`.
Whenever new rules are detected, Snort is restarted and rules are taken into
account. In general it doesn't make sense to trigger this action more often
then once a day as currently selected rules publishers are publishing new rules
at most once a day.

Rules
-----

By default MORCE uses Snort 3 Community Rules[3] and subset of Open Emerging
Threads ruleset[4]. You can use `/etc/init.d/morce update_rules` to check for
updated rules.
